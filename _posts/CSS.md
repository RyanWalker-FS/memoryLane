The second subject that we had to learn was CSS. Originally we only used vanilla CSS. If I had to describe CSS I would describe it as finicky. Almost for no matter how long you work on something it is very difficult to get it just right how you want it. I used quite a few websites to help with my CSS skills but I dont feel as comfortable with CSS as I do HTML but I feel like that is pretty normal. There are some websites that have css challenges where you try and make your image match a example image that I enjoyed but I cant remember what the name was.
