Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental technology for web development, allowing developers to style and design web pages. It works alongside HTML and JavaScript to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. CSS defines styles such as colors, fonts, layouts, and animations, making websites more attractive and functional. There are three main types of CSS: inline CSS, which is applied directly within an HTML tag; internal CSS, which is defined within a <style> tag inside an HTML document; and external CSS, which is stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML. Using CSS ensures a clear separation between content and design, improves consistency across web pages, and allows for responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Additionally, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS make designing websites even more efficient. Mastering CSS is essential for creating stylish, interactive, and user-friendly web experiences.
