HTML was the first thing I learned to code before I started Full Sail. I used FreeCodeCamp as a way to get a head start on coding before school started. I felt really comfortable when in the first coding classes and I was very happy I was able to do so well. I do feel very good about my skills with HTML but I dont think you can ever know everything about any coding language really and continued learning is going to be a must.
