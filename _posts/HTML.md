HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of every webpage, providing the basic structure for content on the internet. It uses a system of elements and tags to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other components that make up a webpage. HTML works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the core of web development. Each HTML document consists of a <head> section, which contains metadata and links to stylesheets or scripts, and a <body> section, where the visible content is placed. With the introduction of HTML5, new semantic elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer> have improved accessibility and search engine optimization. Understanding HTML is essential for anyone looking to build or edit websites, as it provides the foundation upon which all web content is created.
