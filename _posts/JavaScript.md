JavaScript is a powerful programming language that adds interactivity, dynamic content, and functionality to websites. It works alongside HTML and CSS, enabling developers to create engaging user experiences through animations, form validations, real-time updates, and more. JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing it to dynamically update content without requiring a page reload. With the rise of frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript has become even more essential for building modern web applications. Additionally, JavaScript runs in the browser, making it a versatile language for both client-side and server-side development with platforms like Node.js. As a fundamental part of web development, mastering JavaScript opens the door to creating responsive, interactive, and high-performance applications.
