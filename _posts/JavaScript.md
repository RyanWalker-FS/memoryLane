The subject or language I have spent the most time learning is JavaScript. This is the one I cant find to get a grasp of very well. So badly its kind of given me a lot of self doubt. Anytime I finish school early in the week then I go to freecodecamp to do some extra studying. There is so much that we have been given to learn that it feels like the term "drinking out of a fire hose." I know that if I keep studying extra then hopefully what I know will be more on par with what we are being asked to do in the classes I will be in. But until then I just have to keep doing the best I can.
